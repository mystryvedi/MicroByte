# 846. Hand of Straights

# Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and consists of groupSize consecutive cards.

# Given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize, return true if she can rearrange the cards, or false otherwise.

# Example 1:

# Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
# Output: true
# Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]
# Example 2:

# Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
# Output: false
# Explanation: Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= hand.length <= 104
# 0 <= hand[i] <= 109
# 1 <= groupSize <= hand.length
